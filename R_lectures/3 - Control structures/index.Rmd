## Motivation

+ The statements in R are executed sequentially (normally).
+ But sometimes you might:
  - Execute some statemets repetitively (`for`, `while`)
  - Execute statements only if certain conditions are met (`if-else`)
  
**e.g.**
  + Read multiple files at once (.agd).
  + Identify valid participants given their MVPA minutes.

## Repetition and looping

--- .class #id 



## Repetition and looping

Looping constructs repetitively execute a statement or series of statements until a condition is not true.

 + `for`
 + `while`
 + `repeat`*

---

## For

The `for` loop executes a statement repetitively until a variable’s value is no longer contained in the sequence `seq`. The syntaxis is:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
for(var in seq){
  statement
}
```

where,
+ *var* is a variable name,
+ *seq* is a vector of any type, and
+ *statement* is the statement you want to execute repetitively.

---

## For - Example 1

Print the numbers from 1 to 10
```{r}
nums <- 1:10
```

```{r}
  for(i in nums){
    print(i)
  }
```


---

## For - Example 2

The for loop can also iterate other data type vectors.

```{r}
  weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")
```

```{r}
  for(day in weekdays){
    print(day)
  }
```

---

## For - Example 3

`seq_along(x)` function returns a numeric vector of the form `1:length(x)`. It can be used as argument for the for loop.

```{r}
  weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")
```

```{r}
  for(i in seq_along(weekdays)){
    day <- weekdays[i]
    print(day)
  }
```

---

## For - Exercises

1. Write a program which sums the integers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop (and prints the total at the end).
2. Write a program which finds the factorial of a given number. E.g. 3 factorial, or 3! is equal to 3 x 2 x 1; 5! is equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, etc.. Your program should only contain a single loop.

---

## While

A `while` loop executes a statement repetitively until the condition is no longer true. The sintaxys is: 

```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
while(cond){
  statement
}
```

## Conditional execution

---

## Conditional execution

In conditional execution, a statement or statements are executed only if a specified condition is met. 

These constructs include:
  + `if-else`
  + `ifelse`

---

## if-else

The `if-else` control structure executes a statement if a given condition is true.

```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Option 1
if(cond){
  statement #do something
}
```

```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Option 2
if(cond){
  statement1 # do something
} else{
  statement2 # do somenthing else
}
```

---

## if-else

```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Option 3
if(cond1){
  statement1 # do something
} else if(cond2){
  statement2 # do somenthing different
} else{
  statement3 # do something else
}
```


---

## ifelse

The `ifelse` construct is a compact and vectorized version of the `if-else` construct.
The syntax is:

```{r,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ifelse(cond,statement1,statement2)
```

+ The first statement is executed if *cond* is `TRUE`. If *cond* is `FALSE`, the second statement is executed.

+ Use `ifelse` when you want to take a binary action or when you want to input and output
vectors from the construct.

## Remarks

+ Looping in R can be inefficient and time consuming when you’re processing the rows or columns of large datasets.
+ Whenever possible, it’s better to use R’s built-in numerical and character functions in conjunction with the apply family of functions.

## Motivation

+ The statements in R are executed sequentially (normally).
+ But sometimes you might:
  - Execute some statemets repetitively (`for`, `while`)
  - Execute statements only if certain conditions are met (`if-else`)
  
**e.g.**
  + Read multiple files at once (.agd).
  + Identify valid participants given their MVPA minutes.

## Repetition and looping

Looping constructs repetitively execute a statement or series of statements until a condition is not true.

 + `for`
 + `while`
 + `repeat`*

---

## For

The `for` loop executes a statement repetitively until a variable’s value is no longer contained in the sequence `seq`. The syntaxis is:


```r
> for(var in seq){
+   statement
+ }
```

---
## While

A `while` loop executes a statement repetitively until the condition is no longer true. The sintaxys is: 


```r
> while(cond){
+   statement
+ }
```

## Conditional execution

---

## Conditional execution

In conditional execution, a statement or statements are executed only if a specified condition is met. 

These constructs include:
  + `if-else`
  + `ifelse`

---

## if-else

The `if-else` control structure executes a statement if a given condition is true.


```r
> # Option 1
> if(cond){
+   statement #do something
+ }
```


```r
> # Option 2
> if(cond){
+   statement1 # do something
+ } else{
+   statement2 # do somenthing else
+ }
```

---

## if-else


```r
> # Option 3
> if(cond1){
+   statement1 # do something
+ } else if(cond2){
+   statement2 # do somenthing different
+ } else{
+   statement3 # do something else
+ }
```


---

## ifelse

The `ifelse` construct is a compact and vectorized version of the `if-else` construct.
The syntax is:


```r
> ifelse(cond,statement1,statement2)
```

+ The first statement is executed if *cond* is `TRUE`. If *cond* is `FALSE`, the second statement is executed.

+ Use `ifelse` when you want to take a binary action or when you want to input and output
vectors from the construct.

## Remarks

+ Looping in R can be inefficient and time consuming when you’re processing the rows or columns of large datasets.
+ Whenever possible, it’s better to use R’s built-in numerical and character functions in conjunction with the apply family of functions.

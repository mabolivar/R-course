## What is R?

<center><img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/></center>

+ R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
+ R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques.


--- 

## Why should we learn R?


+ Open source
+ Cross-platform compatible
+ Advance statistical language
+ Outstanding graphs
+ Built-in modules
+ Extensible
+ Vast community 
+ Short program length
+ Widely supported (Books, web pages, etc)

---

## RStudio

RStudio is an IDE that makes R easier to use and more productive.

## Data types & data structures

**R** has a wide variety of **data types**:

+ Numeric
+ String
+ Logical (True/False)
+ Date

And **data structures**:

+ Vectors
+ Lists
+ Factors
+ Matrices
+ Data frames


---

## Vector

The basic data structure in R is the vector.
  + All elements must be the same type.
  + Created with `c()` (combine).

```{r vectors1}
#Numeric vector
a <- c(1,2,3,6,-2,4)

#Character vector
b <- c("one","two","three")

#logical vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
```

---

## Vector

Vectors have three common properties
 + `typeof()`: what it is.
 + `length()`: how many elements contains.
 + `attributes`: additionally arbitrary data.

```{r vectors3}
a
typeof(a)
length(a)
attributes(a)
```

---

## Vector

Given a vector, you can ask if correspond to certain type:
 + `is.numeric()`
 + `is.integer()`
 + `is.character()`
 + `is.logical()`
 
```{r}
is.character(a)
is.numeric(a)
```

---

## Vector coercion

Q: What happend if you attempt to combine different elements types in one vector?

```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
 c(FALSE,1,2)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
 c(1,2,"three")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
 c(FALSE,3,"two")
```

---

## Vector coercion

A: They will be coerced to the most **flexible type**.

<center>logical `<` integer `<` double `<` character
</center>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 c(FALSE,1,2)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 c(1,2,"three")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 c(FALSE,3,"two")
```

---

## Extra: The `str()` function

+ `str()` is short for instruction.
+ `str()` provides a human readable description of any R data structure.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 str(c(FALSE,1,2))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 str(c(1,2,"three"))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
 str(c(FALSE,3,"two"))
```

---

## Lists

List can contain elements of any type, including lists.
  + Use `list()` to construct lists.
  + Some built-in functions returns lists as output.
  
```{r}
x <- list(5:9,a,b,c, list("four","five"))
```

What is going to return the command `str(x)`?

---

## Lists

List can contain elements of any type, including lists.
  + Use `list()` to construct lists.
  + Some built-in functions returns lists as output.
  
```{r}
x <- list(5:9,a,b,c, list("four","five"))
```

What is going to return the command `str(x)`?

```{r, echo=F}
str(x)
```

---

## Factors

A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data (Wickham, 2014).

```{r}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
```

```{r}
class(x)
levels(x)
```

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

---

## Matrices

+ Adding a dim() attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array (matrix).
+ Matrices are created with `matrix()`.

```{r}
#A matrix of 3x4 dimensions
a <- matrix(1:12,ncol=4, nrow=3)
a
```

---

## Matrices

+ Adding a dim() attribute to a vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array (matrix).
+ Matrices are created with `matrix()`.

```{r}
#A matrix of 3x4 dimensions
a <- matrix(1:12,ncol=4, nrow=3)
a
```

```{r}
#A second matrix
b <- 1:12
dim(b) <- c(3,4)
```

Are matrices `a` and `b` equal?

---


## Arrays

+ An array is matrix of more than two dimensions.
+ Arrays are created with `array()`.

```{r}
c <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
c
```

---

## Names and dimensions

+ `nrow()` and `ncol()` return the number of rows and columns for a matrix respectively.
+ `dim()` "returns" the dimensions of an array (including matrices)

```{r}
nrow(a)
ncol(a)
dim(c)
```

What do `length()` and `dim()` return when they are applied to a matrix?

```{r, results="hide"}
rownames(a)
```

colnames(a)
```

```

colnames(a) <- c("a","b","c","d")
```

```{r}
a
```

```{r}
str(a)
```

## Data frames

A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and if used systematically makes data analysis easier.

 + A data frame is a list of equal-length vectors.
 + This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it shares properties of matrices and lists.
 + The data frames have `names()`, `colnames()`, `rownames()`, `ncol()`, and `nrow()`. 

---

## Data frames

`data.frame()` takes vectors as input and creates data.frames.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

---

## Data frames

`data.frame()` takes vectors as input and creates data.frames.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

```{r}
df
```

+ How are they similar to matrices?
+ How are similar to lists? 
  (Hint: `str()`)

--- 

## Data frames with factors

+ `data.frame` convert character vectors into factors by default.
+ To avoid this, you can use `stringAsFactors = FALSE`.


```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(df)
```

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
```

---

## Coersion

You can coerce an object to a data frame with `as.data.frame()`:

+ A vector will create a one-column data frame.
+ A list will create one column for each element; it’s an error if they’re not all the same length.
+ A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and rows as the matrix.

Lets try:

```{r}
x <- as.data.frame(a)
```

## Combining data frames

Data frames con be combined using `cbind()` or `rbind()`.

```{r, results="hide"}
cbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1))
```

```{r, results = "hide"}
rbind(df, data.frame(x=10,y = "z"))
```

```{r}
cbind(df, data.frame(z = 3:1))
```

```{r}
rbind(df, data.frame(x=10,y = "z"))
```

---

## Exercises

1. If `is.matrix(x)` is TRUE, what will `is.array(x)` return?
2. What does `as.matrix()` do when applied to a data frame with columns of different types?
3. Given two vectors `a = c(1:3)` and `b = c("a","b","c")`, if I want to build a data.frame maintaining the vectors' orginal data types, should I combine them first and them turn them as data.frame or visceversa? (Hint: `cbind()`)
